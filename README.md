# OCaml dune linting demos

These demos are associated with [my blog post "OCaml linting tools and techniques"](https://sim642.eu/blog/2024/05/01/ocaml-linting/).
In particular, [the Ppxlib techniques table](https://sim642.eu/blog/2024/05/01/ocaml-linting/#ppxlib-techniques) gives an overview of the demos in this repository.
